# Deep-Lesion Scan: A Soft Attention-Enhanced ResNet Model for Skin Lesion Classification

## Introduction
**Deep-Lesion Scan** is a deep learning project focused on early skin cancer detection by classifying dermoscopic images. It enhances the traditional ResNet50 model with a lightweight Soft Attention mechanism that helps the network focus on diagnostically critical regions. This design addresses key limitations of traditional CNNs, such as uniform feature processing and lack of interpretability. Using the HAM10000 dataset, the model demonstrates improved accuracy, better sensitivity for minority classes, and offers visual interpretability through attention maps â€” making it suitable for clinical applications.

## Project Technical Details

### Terminologies
- **Skin Lesion:** Abnormal skin growth, can be benign or malignant.
- **Dermoscopy:** Imaging technique revealing sub-surface structures of skin lesions.
- **ResNet50:** A deep convolutional network with residual connections.
- **Soft Attention:** Mechanism to highlight important spatial features in images.
- **Label Smoothing:** Regularization method to prevent overconfident predictions.
- **Attention Maps:** Visualizations of the modelâ€™s focus regions during prediction.
- **ROC-AUC:** Metric evaluating model's ability to distinguish between classes.

## Problem Statement
- **Uniform Feature Treatment:** Standard CNNs treat all regions equally, missing key lesion features.
- **Imbalanced Dataset:** Common lesion classes dominate, hurting sensitivity for rare types.
- **Lack of Interpretability:** "Black-box" behavior of CNNs limits trust in clinical practice.

---

## Research Gaps
- **Bias Toward Common Lesions:** Most models favor common types (e.g., nevi).
- **Poor Localization:** CNNs do not emphasize diagnostic lesion regions.
- **Trust Barriers:** No clear explanations of model decisions for clinicians.

---

## Proposed Solution
- **Enhanced Model:** Integrate a Soft Attention module into ResNet50 after the final convolutional block.
- **Efficient Training:** Apply class-wise augmentation, weighted losses, label smoothing, and two-stage fine-tuning.
- **Interpretability:** Generate attention heatmaps showing the modelâ€™s diagnostic focus points.
- **Performance:** Achieve high accuracy while maintaining model efficiency.
